= Kaitai Struct: Java notes
:toc: left

== Source files generation

To use Kaitai Struct specifications in Java, one must compile .ksy
specs to .java classes implementing parsing/serialization logic first:

* This can be done manually: by <<user_guide.adoc#invocation,invoking
  kaitai-struct-compiler directly>>, and adding generated files to
  your project.
* For certain build pipelines, the process can be automated by
  introducing this generation step into build flow:
** for https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven]: https://github.com/valery1707/kaitai-maven-plugin[kaitai-maven-plugin]
** for https://gradle.org[Gradle]: https://github.com/valery1707/kaitai-gradle-plugin[kaitai-gradle-plugin]

== Usage patterns

Parsing a structure directly from a local file:

[source,java]
----
AnExampleClass.fromFile("an_example.data")
----

Parsing a structure from a byte array (`byte[]`):

[source,java]
----
new AnExampleClass(new KaitaiStream(byteArray))
----

Note that parsing from non-seekable streams (i.e.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileInputStream.html[FileInputStream],
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedInputStream.html[BufferedInputStream],
etc) is not supported and probably won't be supported, as a lot of
parsing functionality in KS relies on seek support.


== Runtime library

=== Installation

Generated code for Java relies on
https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_java_runtime[Kaitai Struct
runtime library for Java]. It is a small, MIT-licensed library, which
is
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22kaitai-struct-runtime%22[published
in Maven's Central Repository], so typically it's enough to add the
following to one's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.kaitai</groupId>
    <artifactId>kaitai-struct-runtime</artifactId>
    <version>0.10</version>
</dependency>
----

For other build tools, such as Ivy, SBT, Gradle, Leiningen, Buildr,
etc, please consult Central Repository's page for exact instructions.

Alternatively, one can just copy whole source code to one's project:
the library is intentionally kept as only 2 .java files, so it should
be easy enough as well.

=== API

Following most other runtimes example, everything revolves around two
basic classes:

* KaitaiStruct — a common superclass for all classes that represent
  user types in KS. Java implementation is very limited and basically
  only keeps `+_io+` member of type KaitaiStream and provides a getter
  for it.
* KaitaiStream — a useful abstraction of seekable input stream that
  can be read with <<stream_api.adoc#,Kaitai Struct stream API>>
  (i.e. methods like `readU4le()`. Internally, it uses a
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer]
  (either a
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/MappedByteBuffer.html[MappedByteBuffer]
  backed by
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html[FileChanel]
  for parsing local files, or a regular wrapper over a given byte
  array), so it can work on both local files and in-memory data.

== Naming

KS tries to follow mandatory and recommended Java practices as close as
possible.

Class names would be represented in upper camel case (i.e.
`an_example_class` => `AnExampleClass`).

All attributes and instance names use lower camel case (i.e.
`an_example_attribute` => `anExampleAttribute`).

== Types

All user types are mapped 1-to-1 to relevant Java classes. Nested types
are mapped to nested classes, i.e. for nested types like this:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: parent
# ...
types:
  child:
    # ...
    types:
      grandchild:
        # ...
----

one can expect to get the following class structure:

[source,java]
----
public class Parent extends KaitaiStruct {
    public static class Child extends KaitaiStruct {
        public static class GrandChild extends KaitaiStruct {
        }
    }
}
----

Every generated class will have 3 constructors and a static factory
method (plus a private `+_read()+` method that is invoked from all the
constructors to do actual parsing):

[source,java]
----
public AnExampleClass(KaitaiStream _io)
public AnExampleClass(KaitaiStream _io, KaitaiStruct _parent)
public AnExampleClass(KaitaiStream _io, KaitaiStruct _parent, AnExampleClass _root)
public static AnExampleClass fromFile(String fileName)
----

== Attributes

Sequence attribute parsing is done in `+_read()+` method which is
typically invoked from a constructor. All parsed attributes are stored
as private member variables.

For all attributes, a relevant getter method will be generated, so an
attribute can be accessed outside of class like
`classInstance.anExampleAttribute()`.

== Primitive type mapping

There are several things of note that influence mapping KS types to Java
types:

* There are no support for unsigned integer types in Java. In some cases
it's no big deal, but some use cases (for example, comparison or bit
shifts) may be severely hindered by that issue. KS tries to make up for
that fact by using larger signed types where that's possible and
reasonable to do. Where it's not possible (i.e. 64-bit unsigned integers
— `u8`), KS would use signed `long` type.
* Java has 2 types for every numeric type: "primitive" type (i.e. `int`)
and "reference" type (i.e. `Integer`) — the latter being a full-featured
object that can have `null` assigned to it and stored in collections.
It's not practical to use reference types everywhere, so KS makes use of
them only in the following situations:
* when data type is used as part of a collection
* when it's possible that a particular attribute / instance will be
unassigned (i.e. because of [[if|attribute description#if]] expression)
— `null` will be returned in this case

The overall primitive type mapping goes as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|================================================
|`type` |Java primitive type |Java reference type
|no type |byte[] |byte[]
|`u1` |int |Integer
|`u2` |int |Integer
|`u4` |long |Long
|`u8` |long |Long
|`s1` |byte |Byte
|`s2` |short |Short
|`s4` |int |Integer
|`s8` |long |Long
|`str`, `strz` |String |String
|================================================

=== String encoding

Encoding a stream of bytes into a `String` is done with the standard
Java API:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#String(byte%5B%5D,%20java.nio.charset.Charset)[String
method constructor]

== Array types

All repetitions in Java are translated to `ArrayList<~>`
